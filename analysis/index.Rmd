## Introduction

Phenotypic heterogeneity in cell populations has been shown to play critical
roles in determining biologically and clinically significant phenotypes. The
goal of this project is to identify _robustness QTLs_, loci in the human genome
that are associated with within-individual variation in gene expression levels.

## Data collection 

We [collected single cell RNA-seq data](data-collection.html) from YRI
invididuals using the C1 platform. We [pooled and sequenced](totals.html) each
C1 chip on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

We identified sample swaps and [matched samples to individuals](identity.html)
using verifyBamID.

Next, we [filtered low quality samples](sampleqc.html) and both [over- and
 lowly-expressed genes](filter-gene.html) for downstream analysis.

We then [performed dimensionality reduction](dim-reduction.html) on the
quality-controlled samples and genes to identify the remaining major sources of
variation.

## QTL mapping

We first [investigated the concordance between scRNA-Seq and matched bulk
RNA-seq data](sc-vs-bulk.html).

We then built an [interactive
browser](https://hpimentel.shinyapps.io/eqtl-shiny/) to view the distribution
of scRNA-Seq counts stratified by genotype at top eQTLs in the matched bulk
RNA-Seq data.

Next, we [estimated means and dispersions](zinb.html) per individual per
gene. We then [treated these as continuous phenotypes and mapped
QTLs](qtl-mapping.html) using QTLtools.
