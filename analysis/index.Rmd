Phenotypic heterogeneity in cell populations has been shown to play critical
roles in determining biologically and clinically significant phenotypes. The
goal of this project is to identify _robustness QTLs_, loci in the human genome
that are associated with within-individual variation in gene expression levels.

## Data collection and quality control

We [collected single cell RNA-seq data](data-collection.html) from YRI
invididuals using the C1 platform. We [pooled and sequenced](totals.html) each
C1 chip on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

We [matched samples to individuals](identity.html) using `verifyBamID`.

We [filtered low quality samples](sampleqc.html) and both [over- and
 lowly-expressed genes](filter-gene.html) for downstream analysis.

We [performed dimensionality reduction](dim-reduction.html) on the
quality-controlled samples and genes to identify the remaining major sources of
variation.

## QTL mapping

We [estimated means and dispersions](zinb.html) per individual per gene using
zero-inflated negative binomial models.

We [derived continuous phenotypes from the fitted models and mapped
QTLs](qtl-mapping.html) using QTLtools.

We [estimated the power to detect dispersion effects](power.html) as a function
of the single cell experiment size.
