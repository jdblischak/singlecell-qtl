## Initial setup

The initial setup only has to be performed once for each computer that you use.

To ensure all contributors are using the same computational environment, we use
[conda][] to manage software dependencies (made possible by the [bioconda][] and
[conda-forge][] projects). Please complete the following steps to replicate the
computing environment. Note that this is only guaranteed to work on a Linux-64
based architecture, but in theory should be able to work on macOS as well. All
commands shown below are intended to be run in a Bash shell from the root of the
project directory.

1. Install Git and register for an account on GitHub

1. Download and install [Miniconda3][miniconda]
    * Run `bash Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`
    * Press `ENTER` to start installation
    * Press `q` when finished reading the license and then type `yes`
    * Type the location for installation (press `ENTER` to accept the default of `~/miniconda3`)
    * Type `yes` to add Miniconda to your `PATH` variable
    * Run `source ~/.bash_profile` on macOS or `source ~/.bashrc` on Linux to update `PATH`
    * Run `which conda` to confirm that `conda` was installed

1. Clone this repository (or your personal fork)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jdblischak/singlecell-qtl.git
    cd singlecell-qtl
    ```

1. Create the conda environment "scqtl" using `environment.yaml`
    ```
    conda env create --file environment.yaml
    ```

1. To use the conda environment, you must first activate it by running `source
activate scqtl`. This will override your default settings for R, Python, and
various other software packages. When you are done working on this project, you
can either logout of the current session or deactivate the environment.
    ```
    # Activate conda environment scqtl
    source activate scqtl
    # Deactivate conda environment
    source deactivate
    ```

1. Initialize [git-lfs][] and download the latest version of large data files
    ```
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
    ```

**Warning:** If you are using RStudio, you need to ensure that it recognizes
  your conda environment. If you launch RStudio by clicking on an icon, it
  doesn't use the current environment you have configured in your shell. On a
  Linux-based system, the solution is to launch RStudio directly from the shell
  with `rstudio`. On macOS, running `open -a rstudio .` from the shell causes
  RStudio to recognize most of the environment variables, but strangely it does
  not set the correct library path to the conda R packages. Suggestions for how
  to fix this are welcome.

## Regular setup

Once you have performed the [initial setup](#initial-setup) on your computer,
the regular setup you have to perform each time you want to work on the project
is much quicker. Navigate to the singlecell-qtl directory, activate the conda
environment, and pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository.

```
cd singlecell-qtl
source activate scqtl
git pull
```

If there are updates to `environment.yaml`, you can update the "scqtl" conda 
environment. You may want to do this occasionally just to be sure you have all
the software you need.

```
conda env update --file environment.yaml
```

## Bioinformatics pipeline

The main steps of the bioinformatics pipeline are:

* Reads that do not have a valid UMI are removed
* UMIs are extracted with [UMI-tools][umi-tools] (`umi_tools extract`)
* Reads are mapped to the genome with [Subjunc][subjunc]
* Reads are deduplicated based on their UMI with [UMI-tools][umi-tools]
(`umi_tools dedup`; output referred to as molecules)
* Molecules are assigned to genes with [featureCounts][featurecounts]
* The identity of the single cells is determined with [verifyBamID][verifybamid]

The pipeline is implemented with [Snakemake][snakemake]. The 
[Snakefile][snakefile] controls this process, ensuring that output files are 
updated when upstream files are changed. Options for the pipeline are set in
[config.yaml][], options for submission to Slurm are set in [cluster.json][],
the Bash script for executing Snakemake is in [submit-snakemake.sh][], and the
Slurm sbatch file for submitting the pipeline is [snakemake.sbatch][].

## Using ExpressionSet objects

The processed data for each C1 chip is stored in its own RDS file, a binary 
format for storing R objects. The RDS file contains an [ExpressionSet][eset] 
object. The ExpressionSet class stores the RNA-seq counts along with metadata on
the samples, features (e.g. genes), and experimental details.

To import the data, use the R function `readRDS()`. Because the ExpressionSet 
class is defined in the Bioconductor package Biobase, it will be loaded the 
first time you access the loaded ExpressionSet object. To avoid the long startup
message that the Biobase package prints, here it is loaded prior to importing
the object.

```{r load-eset}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("Biobase"))
eset <- readRDS("../data/eset/03162017.rds")
```

Executing the object in the R console provides an overall summary of what it contains.

```{r eset-show}
eset
```

But each element of the object can be extracted individually, for example:

```{r eset-extract}
# Dimensions
dim(eset)
# Sample names
head(sampleNames(eset))
# Expression data
exprs(eset)[1:5, 1:5]
# Sample-level variables ("phenotype data")
pData(eset)[1:5, 1:5]
# Descriptions of the sample-level variables
varMetadata(eset)[1:5, , drop = FALSE]
# Gene-level variables ("feature data")
head(fData(eset))
# Descriptions of the gene-level metrics
fvarMetadata(eset)
# Experimental details
experimentData(eset)
# Abstract
abstract(eset)
# Proprocessing steps
preproc(eset)
```

A nice feature of ExpressionSets is that any subsetting applied to either the
sample-level or gene-level variables is automatically propagated to the
expression matrix.

```{r eset-subset}
eset_quality <- eset[fData(eset)$source == "H. sapiens",
                     eset$cell_number == 1 & eset$tra1.60]
dim(eset_quality)
```

Multiple ExpressionSet objects can also be combined. The following code imports
and combines the data for all 10 C1 chips from batch 1.

```{r eset-combine}
chips <- c("03162017.rds", "03172017.rds", "03232017.rds",
           "03302017.rds", "03312017.rds", "04052017.rds",
           "04072017.rds", "04132017.rds", "04142017.rds",
           "04202017.rds")
fname <- Map(function(x) paste0("../data/eset/", x), chips)
batch1 <- Reduce(combine, Map(readRDS, fname))
dim(batch1)
```

To read in the entire data set, use the combined ExpressionSet object (it's much
faster to load just one serialized data file).

```{r eset-total}
eset_total <- readRDS("../data/eset.rds")
dim(eset_total)
```

To learn more about the data that can be stored in an ExpressionSet object and 
methods to access the data, please see the help pages for ExpressionSet and its
parent class eSet.

```{r eset-man-pages, eval=FALSE}
?ExpressionSet
?eSet
```


## Using combined data files

For convenience, the combined data are available in single files.

The annotation for all the single cells is in
[data/scqtl-annotation.txt](https://github.com/jdblischak/singlecell-qtl/blob/master/data/scqtl-annotation.txt).
The description of the annotation columns is in
[data/scqtl-annotation-description.txt](https://github.com/jdblischak/singlecell-qtl/blob/master/data/scqtl-annotation-description.txt).

```{r input-combined-annotation}
anno <- read.delim("../data/scqtl-annotation.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
anno_descrip <- read.delim("../data/scqtl-annotation-description.txt",
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(anno_descrip, 3)
```

The combined counts are in
[data/scqtl-counts.txt.gz](https://github.com/jdblischak/singlecell-qtl/blob/master/data/scqtl-counts.txt.gz).
Note that because this file is large, it is stored using [Git LFS][git-lfs].
Thus you must follow the [setup instructions above](#initial-setup) to download
this file to your local computer. I recommend importing it with
`data.table::fread`.

```{r input-combined-counts}
library("data.table")
counts <- data.frame(fread("zcat ../data/scqtl-counts.txt.gz"), row.names = 1)
dim(counts)
counts[1:5, 1:2]
```

## Data analysis workflow

The data analysis is organized using the R package [workflowr][]. Here are the
basics:

```{r workflowr-basics, eval=FALSE}
# Create a new analysis file using the workflowr
wflow_open("analysis/new.Rmd")
# Build the website locally
wflow_build()
# Build and commit the website files
wflow_publish("analysis/new.Rmd", "Add a new analysis")
```

Ideally `wflow_publish()` will be run using the conda environment scqtl so that
the final results are always generated using the same versions of the software.
If you are using RStudio, you may need to open R from the command line to
execute `wflow_publish()` in the conda environment.

More information on workflowr can be found in the [online
documentation][workflowr-docs].

## Adding large files to the Git repo

Since we use [Git LFS][git-lfs], we can version large binary files with Git
without worrying about the size of the Git repo. Before you do anything with
large files, make sure you have activated the conda environment to ensure that
you have Git LFS installed.

1. Activate the conda environment:
    ```
    source activate scqtl
    ```

1. Check the currently tracked file extensions:
    ```
    git lfs track
    ```

1. If the file extension is not yet being tracked, you first need to track it.
For example, if you wanted to use Git LFS with files that end in the extension
`.xyz`, you would run the following:
    ```
    git lfs track "*.xyz"
    git add .gitattributes
    ```

1. Once the file extension is being tracked, add and commit the file like any
other file (you need to specify the `-f` flag for "force" because the directory
`data/` is ignored by default to prevent accidentally committing a large file):
    ```
    git add -f data/filename.xyz
    git commit
    ```

1. Before pushing to GitHub, confirm that the large file was properly committed
by running `git log --stat`. The file that was committed should only be a few
lines long because it is a plain text file with a pointer to the version of the
large file on GitHub's servers.

## Installation of R packages outside of conda environment

There may be situations where you cannot access the R packages installed in the
conda environment (e.g. running RStudio on macOS, or RStudio Server). The code
below installs the necessary R packages from [CRAN][cran], [Bioconductor][bioc],
and [GitHub][gh].

Install R packages from [CRAN][cran]:

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowplot", "data.table", "devtools", "dplyr", "ggplot2",
                 "readr", "rmarkdown", "stringr", "testit", "tidyr")
```

Install R packages from [Bioconductor][bioc]:

```{r install-bioc, eval=FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("Biobase", "biomaRt", "edgeR"))
```

Install R packages from [GitHub][gh]:

```{r install-github, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jdblischak/workflowr")
```

## Tips and tricks

### Enable Bash auto-completion for Git on macOS

Manually typing `git pull origin master` and other long Git commands is a pain.
To enable [Bash auto-completion][git-complete] (i.e. tab-completion) for Git on
macOS, follow these [steps][git-complete-steps]:

1. Download the Bash completion script:
    ```
    curl -L https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash > ~/git-completion.bash
    ```

1. Add the following line to your .bash_profile:
    ```
    source ~/git-completion.bash
    ```

3. Re-run your .bash_profile:
    ```
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

### Install git-lfs locally

The [Initial setup instructions](#initial-setup) install git-lfs using conda.
Therefore you need to have the conda environment active (`source activate
scqtl`) whenever you run a Git command, which ensures that the large files are
always handled properly by Git. Since it can be easy to forget to first activate
the conda environment, a safety measure would be to install git-lfs on your
local machine (i.e. outside of the conda environment). This will ensure that
git-lfs is always available even when you forget to activate the conda
environment.

There are multiple [methods][git-lfs-install] to install git-lfs. Below are
instructions to download a pre-built binary.

1. Download the software:
    ```
    cd ~/Downloads
    # 64-bit macOS:
    curl -OL https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.3.0/git-lfs-darwin-amd64-2.3.0.tar.gz
    # 64-bit Linux:
    curl -OL https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.3.0/git-lfs-linux-amd64-2.3.0.tar.gz
    ```

1. Extract the software and copy the executable files into `~/bin` (note: you
can put it anywhere you like, but this is a conventional place to put executable
files):
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/bin
    tar xzf git-lfs-*.tar.gz
    cd git-lfs-2.3.0/
    cp git-lfs install.sh ~/bin
    ```

1. Add `~/bin` to your `PATH` by adding the following line to your
`~/.bash_profile` (macOS) or `.bashrc` (Linux):
    ```
    export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
    ```
     Note that `~/bin` is already included in `PATH` by default on at least some
     Linux distributions.

1. Update `PATH`:
    ```
    # macOS
    source ~/.bash_profile
    # Linux
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Just to be safe, run the git-lfs install script (this modifies the file
`~/.gitconfig`). This is unnecessary if you have already gone through the
[Initial setup instructions](#initial-setup) on this machine, but it doesn't
hurt to run it again:
    ```
    git lfs install
    ```

1. To confirm that you have git-lfs installed locally, run `which git-lfs`. This should point to `~/bin/git-lfs` and not your conda environment. Also run `cat ~/.gitconfig`. It should contain the following (it will also likely have additional lines):
    ```
    [filter "lfs"]
	        clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	        smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	        process = git-lfs filter-process
	        required = true
    ```

### Upgrade RStudio

RStudio has had some major updates with its 1.0 release. If you are using a
version less than 1.0 (check by clicking `Help` -> `About RStudio`), you should
strongly consider [upgrading][rstudio-download]. The most noticeable change for
our workflow is that it has built-in support for R Markdown websites. Thus if
you click the `Knit` button for an R Markdown file in the workflowr project, it
will recognize the settings in the file `analysis/_site.yml` and save the output
HTML in `docs/`.

One annoying new feature you will notice is that the chunks of R Markdown
documents appear inline in the document instead of being executed in the R
console. To restore the previous setting, go to `Tools` -> `Global Options...`
-> `R Markdown` and unselect "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents".

### Open RStudio from the Terminal

On macOS and Linux systems you can run RStudio from a terminal and specify which
working directory to startup within. Additionally, on Linux systems if you run
RStudio from a terminal and specify no command line argument then RStudio will
startup using the current working directory of the terminal.

For example, on macOS you could use the following commands to open RStudio
(respectively) in the `~/projects/foo` directory or the current working
directory:

```
$ open -a RStudio ~/projects/foo
$ open -a RStudio .
```

On Linux you would use the following commands (note that no `.` is necessary in
the second invocation):

```
$ rstudio ~/projects/foo
$ rstudio
```

## FAQ

### Why does Git keep asking for my password repeatedly?

We use [git-lfs][] to version control large files. To push updated versions of these large files requires authentication of the https server where they are stored, and this must be done for each file separately! To reduce the number of times you have to manually enter your password, enable [caching of your GitHub password][git-caching]:

```
git config --global credential.helper cache
```
